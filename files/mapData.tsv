ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_1_CONFIG_COMICS_0_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“They watched in horror as the doorknob slowly began to turn—”<hr/>BEEP BEEP BEEP! The sound of Dax’s stopwatch trilled, interrupting her story.<hr/>“Gotta go!” Dax was off in a flash, running towards the park. Marsh and Pep were left sitting on the bench staring after her, stunned by her sudden exit.
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_1_CONFIG_COMICS_1_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“What’s the rush?” Marsh asked finally, annoyed by the abrupt ending to the scary story.<hr/>“Cartwheel practice!” remembered Pep. “Dax is trying to learn to do a perfect cartwheel.”<hr/>Pep knew how badly Dax wanted to compete in the Olympics one day. “Learning to cartwheel is a key skill for a gymnast, so it's a really important goal.”
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_2_CONFIG_COMICS_0_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	Suddenly Pep jumped up, pointing in Dax's direction. “Do you see that? I think Dax is being followed!”<hr/>Marsh shrugged. “It just looks like clouds of dust to me.”<hr/>But Pep knew better. <hr/>“Clean your glasses, Marsh. That’s a whole grapple of goal gremlins!”
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_2_CONFIG_COMICS_1_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	Marsh blinked at Pep. “Goal gremlins? A grapple? Please explain.”<hr/>Pep told Marsh how goal gremlins are tricksters who want to derail anyone working to meet a goal. They can appear in many forms and are hard to spot. But when you do spot them they lose a lot of their power.”
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_3_CONFIG_COMICS_0_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	Pep suspected that the first gremlin to go after Dax would be the <b>Muddler</b>.<hr/>“This gremlin likes to strike early, when a goal is just getting set,” Pep explained. “It tries to stop you from setting a clear goal. It’s mucky and makes your goal feel hazy and hard to achieve.”<hr/>“Aw, nerts!” whispered Marsh, worrying about Dax.
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_3_CONFIG_COMICS_1_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“Then there's the <b>Distractor</b>,” Pep continued. “Its tactic is to lure you away from your goal.”<hr/>“This gremlin will try to tempt you with all kinds of distractions.”<hr/>“Sneaky!” Marsh squeaked.
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_4_CONFIG_COMICS_0_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“The <b>Swarm of Excuses</b> is the peskiest gremlin,” Pep went on. <hr/>“It can descend on you with all kinds of reasons why you won’t be able to reach your goal.”<hr/>“This gremlin wants to frustrate you. Even worse, it can chip away at your self-confidence.”<hr/>“Annoying!” muttered Marsh.
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_4_CONFIG_COMICS_1_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“Next, watch out for the <b>Procrastinator</b>,” said Pep. <hr/>“Procrasta-what?“ asked Marsh.<hr/>Pep described a sly, charming gremlin that wants goal-setters to think they have all the time in the world.<hr/>“It will try to delay you from working towards your goal!” warned Pep.
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_5_CONFIG_COMICS_0_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“Finally, there’s the creepiest gremlin of all: <b>Vampiro</b>,” Pep whispered.<hr/>“Double nerts.” Marsh whimpered.<hr/>“It doesn't drink blood,” said Pep quickly. “But Vampiro tries to drain your motivation for your goal. It wants you to stop thinking about why your goal matters.”
ACTIVITIES_0_EXERCISES_5_CONFIG_COMICS_1_SPEECHBUBBLES_0_BUBBLETEXT	“Pep, we can't let these gremlins ruin Dax's goal. Or she’ll never reach her Olympic dream!“ Marsh said as they set off to find their friend.<hr/>By the time they reached Dax, she was surrounded. “This is more serious than I thought,” said Pep. “Dax’s goal means so much to her, it’s made these gremlins extra greedy.”<hr/>“Courage!” cried Marsh. “It's time to start gremlin-busting!”
